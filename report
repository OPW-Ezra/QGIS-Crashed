h2. User Feedback

I had a QGIS project opens whihc had a number of layers in it, most of which were unavailable while I had the project open.

I opened up a kmz file as an additional layer and this worked fine, aside from the fact that it had a spurious line in it extending from the location where my physical project is located, to somewhere near the Galapagos Islands I think.  I had zoomed into the far end of the line to see where it was and was then zooing back toward my physical project lcoation when the crash ioccurred.  I had my project KMZ file open and an Open Street map layer open and the system reported a 'bad allocation, and kind of froze after that.

When I tried to close QGIS I then got this error report dialogue
